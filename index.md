## Publications

* ****Bansod, Shruti** & Jaiswal, Rishita & Sargam, Priyanka & Survase, Prajakta & Sawant, Sachin. (2020). ARDUINO BASED
WATER IRRIGATION SYSTEM.**

This paper presents a novel approach towards effective irrigation system. The prepared system comprised of
an Arduino, moisture sensors, submersible water pump, and relay mechanism. The two moisture sensors sense
the condition of dryness of soil at two different places on the field feed the signal to Arduino system will take
the inputs from both the sensors and based on that it will decide how much water should be supplied. This
system will continue to take the inputs from the sensors until there is sufficient amount of moisture in the soil
and then it will automatically turn the pump off. This irrigation system will reduce the hardship of farmers,
save the time and enhance accuracy and effectiveness in relatively minimal cost.
